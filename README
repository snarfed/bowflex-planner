A webapp that optimizes Bowflex exercise routines to minimize rearranging
weights and attachments.

Written in Go and deployed on App Engine at:

http://bowflex-planner.appspot.com/

This was the first nontrivial program I wrote in Go (aka golang), mostly as an
excuse to learn it, so the code isn't particularly pretty and the algorithm
isn't particularly efficient. It uses dynamic programming to generate the
individual step costs, but does exhaustive search across all possible exercise
sequences.
